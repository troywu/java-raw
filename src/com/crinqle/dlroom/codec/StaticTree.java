 *
 * God damn it, Dave!  The number of items in the first 16 elements
 * doesn't even total the correct amount!
 *
 * Argh!  Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar! Arrrr!
 *
 * Added 2 to the SECOND_TREE[0,1,2][15] elements to produce
 * the final codes:
 *
 *     Depth 16 path to (0xa1) --> 1111111111111000
 *     Depth 16 path to (0xc1) --> 1111111111111001
 *     Depth 16 path to (0xe3) --> 1111111111111010
 *     Depth 16 path to (0xa2) --> 1111111111111011
 *     Depth 16 path to (0xe1) --> 1111111111111100
 *  -> Depth 16 path to (0xff) --> 1111111111111101
 *  -> Depth 16 path to (0xff) --> 1111111111111101
 *
 * so that the Huffman tree is completely generated!  Argh!
 *
 * Ar ar ra ar rarar ar ra ar ar ar rarrararaaara rararar!
 *
 * 	-- 28 December 2003 --
 *
 * Okay.  Things are even weirder now.
 *
 * The final value should be 0x00 (zero), not 0xff:
 *
