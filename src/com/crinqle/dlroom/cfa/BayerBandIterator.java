/**
 * This class creates BandIterator objects.  ColorFilterArray uses the
 * filter spec to design the BandIterator object; there is a tacit
 * assumption being made about how the Bayers are setup (i.e., that:
 * <p>
 * "all filter patterns can be described by a repeating pattern of
 * eight rows and two columns."
 * <p>
 * --Dave Coffin (dcraw.c)
 * <p>
 * So long as that assumption holds up, this class will work
 * correctly; if not, the vars f_x1 through f_x<n> will have to be
 * turned into an array.  Until Bayers become that much more complex,
 * this implementation will suffice.  Of course, even if CFAs -do-
 * change, this interface will remain the same (and just slow down a
 * bit).
 * <p>
 * What's very, -VERY- important about this class is that it makes
 * very precarious assumptions about the type of ImageData object.  It
 * can really only work with single-band capture data (raw CMOS or CCD
 * data).  That's because the raw data mixes all the colors into the
 * same band in the image data.  It's the offset and strides that
 * matter here; not the target band.  A multi-band iterator will need
 * to know the target band, too.  In fact, a multi-band iterator may
 * not be necessary (it's not clear that this makes sense...).
 * <p>
 * If it does make sense, a separate class (perhaps
 * BayerMultiBandIterator) needs to be build to work with the
 * pre-interpolated multi-band capture data--which ideally is in RGB,
 * colorspace aside.  I'm not sure how to deal with 4-color images
 * yet, even the 4-color RGB images from some cameras.  More
 * investigation is necessary for 4-color images.
 * <p>
 * -- 9 March 2004 --
 * <p>
 * This class will only work with Bayer CFAs.
 * <p>
 * NOTE!
